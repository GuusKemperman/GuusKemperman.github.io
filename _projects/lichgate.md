Lichgate - a relentless survivor, action rogue-like where you must grow stronger to vanquish the undead - made with our custom-built Coral Engine.

# My Contributions

While I was mostly focused on maintaining and improving Coral Engine throughout this project, I also contributed directly towards the game.

- *Flowfields*: Implemented an optimized flowfield algorithm for **AI** navigation.
- *Procedural Endless World*: Developed tools for Level designers for generating endless, **procedural levels**.
