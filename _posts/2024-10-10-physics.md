Coral Engine has a custom 2D physics system. While the system was created by [Amzy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amalia-amzy-zarcu-001b57295/), I made various contributions over the course of development.

[//]: # (TODO: Consider adding information about adding different collision shapes)

## Terrain height

We initially to have a level with vertical elements, but our physics system only supported 2 dimensions! 

This task was interesting as I was not involved with its original creation, and I had to adhere to the definitions of done already in place.

We have a very simple physics implementation. One constraint we have is that all of our colliders are 2D; the user does not need to specify the height of a cylinder. But now that we would be walking on the terrain, we need to know the height of the colliders beneath our feet.

I decided to use a very simple approach; iterating over the colliders, getting the height of the collider based only on its position, and then choosing the highest collider that overlaps the given 2D point.

The problem is that we are need to transform the colliders to world-space, and calculating tens of thousands of  matrices every frame slowed our program down immensely. 

In order to make this method viable, I made sure to optimise the physics system by creating TransformedColliders; each collision shape is 'transformed' once every frame, for example each AABBCollisionShape will update their corresponding TransformedAABBCollisionShape only once per frame.

Once we had a *relatively* efficient way of obtaining the height at a given position, the rest of the system was a series of small adjustments; only allowing physics bodies to move if the height at the current position roughly matched the height at their desired position.

There was one item missing from the list of DoDs, which was incorporating the new vertical elements into the navigation system, since we do not want our AI to think they can walk off a steep ledge, only to get stuck. I discussed this with the original assignee and added this issue to the original task.

The navmesh we were using was generated based on 2D colliders. We would have to make major changes to both the libraries we use and the information we pass to those libraries if we wanted to create a 3D navmesh. I am not well versed with navmeshes, nor would we have the time to implement such a feature. So instead, I used the flood-fill algorithm to find edges that are too steep, and 'informed' (lied to) the navmesh library that there were 'colliders' at these edges. The AI dutifully avoided the edges.

The final result?

My contribution was clearly visible in the demo and allowed for the creation of more interesting levels. As a bonus, the physics had become significantly faster overall, mainly due to the introduction of AABBs serving as early outs for polygon checks, and by only transforming the colliders once. 

## BVH

We were hoping to create a game with thousands of enemies and even more colliders. Our brute-force approach would no longer hold up. I have written a BVH before for my [raytracing project](/projects/spider-sling.html), and used my old code and knowledge to optimise the physics in Coral Engine.

The physics were now more than fast enough to suit our needs. Even with the many colliders in our benchmarks and final game, we did not experience physics to be a performance bottleneck.
