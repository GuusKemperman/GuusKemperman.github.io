Coral Engine began as a personal project during a summer holiday. Over time, it evolved into a full-fledged engine featuring **visual scripting** and a **robust editor**. From the start, the goal was to create a simple, accessible API for developers while ensuring the engine remained intuitive for designers.

After seven months of solo development, I was joined by five talented programmers to enhance Coral Engine, making it production-ready. We used it to develop [Lichgate](/projects/lichgate). The designers who joined our team were able to utilise its capabilities to create their own prototypes, assets and gameplay features.

I continued working on Coral Engine for several months, ridding it of some technical debt that had built up over the course of development.

# My Contributions

- *[Engine Architecture](/blog/engine-architecture)*: Designed and iterated the **core architecture** from concept to release.
- *[Content Pipeline](/blog/content-pipeline)*: Created a system for importing, editing assets and efficiently managing resources in a **multi-threaded** environment.
- *[Runtime reflection](/blog/runtime-reflection)*: Created a system to represent both C++ and Visual Script classes through a unified interface.
- *[Visual Scripting](/blog/visual-scripting)*: Built a performant node-based **visual-scripting interpreter** from scratch, fully integrated with the ECS system (EnTT).
- *[Optimisations](/blog/visual-scripting-optimisations)*: I have consistently benchmarked, profiled and accordingly optimised the worst bottlenecks.
- *Event handling*: Developed an powerful, easy-to-use event system.
- *[Physics](/blog/physics)*: Helped created a 2D **physics** system with **optimized** collision handling.
- *[Prefab System](/blog/prefabs)*: Implemented a system similar to [**Unity's prefabs**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html), allowing entity euse.
- *Level editor*: Developed a **user-friendly editor** for level design, included tools for quickly transforming objects and undoing changes.
- *Particle system*:  Created an extendable, **data-oriented** particle system.
- *Serialization*: Designed a serialization system with backward compatibility.
- *Unit Test Framework*: Created a light-weight framework for quickly creating tests in-engine.
- *CI/CD*: Set up **GitHub Actions** for automatic compilation, testing, and distribution.
- *[Utility AI](/blog/utility-ai)*: Created a framework for state-based **AI** behaviour.
- *Project management*: I **managed** the team of programmers, overseeing task distribution and ensuring alignment.
- *Frontend*: I played a large part in utilising ImGui to create an accessible interface for designers, including the content browser and most editor windows.
