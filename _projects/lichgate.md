After a year of learning about game engine development, I am proud to present Lichgate - a relentless survivor, action rogue-like where you must grow stronger to vanquish the undead - made with our custom-built Coral Engine.

We have been working as a team on the engine for the past half year, with development starting earlier by our amazing lead programmer Guus Kemperman. Our main focus when creating it was usability and performance, which paid off in our 8-week project Lichgate.

As an aspiring gameplay-oriented tools programmer, I strived for our engine to be accessible to other disciplines as well. Whether it was taking inspiration from Unreal Engine to ease the designers transition to a new framework, or iterating our layout based on user feedback, we tried to pair the complex back-end with an enjoyable interface to work with.

My main contributions were the ability/weapon system, the upgrade system, and the physics system, all crafted with the end user in mind. Working in a cross-disciplinary team has been an enriching experience, providing me with valuable insights into designing user-friendly tools for my colleagues, while remaining efficient with my C++.

Coral Engine began as a personal project during a summer holiday. Over time, it evolved into a full-fledged engine featuring **visual scripting** and a **robust editor**. From the start, the goal was to create a simple, accessible API for developers while ensuring the engine remained intuitive for designers.

After seven months of solo development, I was joined by five talented programmers to enhance Coral Engine, making it production-ready. We used it to develop **[Lichgate](https://buas.itch.io/lichgate)**. The designers who joined our team were able to utilise its capabilities to create their own prototypes, assets and gameplay features.

I continued working on Coral Engine for several months, ridding it of some technical debt that had built up over the course of development.
