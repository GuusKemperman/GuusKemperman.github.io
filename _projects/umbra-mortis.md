I chose to get more experience with working in Unreal and multiplayer programming. 

This project has taught me a lot about the subtle difficulties with networking and replication. I've gained experience with navigating large codebases like Unreal, while working in a moderately sized team.

- Optimising enemy navigation, created efficient local avoidance for 3D environemnts
- Created development tools, such as the objectives system, cheat menu, analytics, automated crash reports & improved logging
- Gameplay features, such as the homing bell, an AI director, spectating and the functionality behind many widgets and triggerable events in the level.
- Bug fixing, mainly replication related issues, giving me a lot of insight into multiplayer programming and leading to an incredibly stable build on release

This page is still under construction, with more details about my contributions coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to check out our game on Steam:
