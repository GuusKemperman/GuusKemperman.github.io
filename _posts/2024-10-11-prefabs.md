I read the Game Engine Architecture book during the holiday. In it, they described prefabs as a solution for designers; they do not have to write or compile any C++ code to create an entity factory, instead, they simply describe a collection of components and default values.

To improve the workflow, prefabs can be edited at runtime through the built-in prefab editor.

On saving the prefab, its changes are applied to any instances of it in levels you may have open.

One of the requirements was serialization. I introduced prefabs, which made serialization/deserialization significantly more complex. If any changes have been made to the prefab, those changes need to be applied during deserialization. 

My solution to this problem was serializing what the prefab looked like at the time of serialization. During deserialization, we can compare the differences; has a component been added or removed? Has a child entity been added or removed?
