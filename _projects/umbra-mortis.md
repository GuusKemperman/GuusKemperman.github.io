Umbra Mortis is a 1-3 player coop FPS shooter, where you fight hordes of zombies in the streets of Venice. 

It was amazing to get experience with Unreal's networking and multiplayer programming systems, and all the challenges that came with them. I was lucky enough to be able to work together in an amazing team of 22 developers, collaborating closely and achieving our goal of a successful Steam release.

# My Contributions

- Created development tools, such as the objectives system, cheat menu, analytics, automated crash reports & improved logging.
- Gameplay features, such as the homing bell, an AI director, spectating, as well as the functionality behind many widgets and triggerable events in the level.
- Optimising enemy navigation, created efficient local avoidance for 3D environments.
- Bug fixing, mainly replication related issues, leading to an incredibly stable build on release.

This page is still under construction, with more details about my contributions coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to check out our game on Steam!
