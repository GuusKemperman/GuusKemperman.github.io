  intro: Hi, I'm Guus! A soon-to-be graduate from Breda University of Applied Sciences, with experience working on commercial engines, while balancing (overly) ambitious personal projects in my free time. I have deep, practical knowledge of C++ and robust problem-solving skills. I am confident I'm able to solve any problem thrown at me. This is matched by strong communication skills and a genuine enthusiasm for contributing as part of a larger team.
