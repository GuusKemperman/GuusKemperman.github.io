    Coral Engine started as a personal project. After seven months I was reinforced by a team of five talented programmers. We extended the engine and ensured it was production-ready for our final project. I've worked as a lead programmer on the development of Lichgate, developed entirely in Coral Engine.<br><br>
    
    My main contributions were creating the core architecture, asset management, runtime reflection, visual scripting and prefabs. I've gained a great deal of experience with designing architectures and APIs to create a framework that is accessible to other programmers.

    This award-winning game was created by a talented team of fifteen individuals over eight weeks. It received the Best Y1 Game 2023 award from industry professionals and the best tech award from BUAS staff. During the project, I honed my skills in using the scrum methodology, collaborating in a multi-disciplinary team, and developing with Unreal Engine. My key responsibilities encompassed AI, the weapons, local multiplayer, and UI development.

    Through my work on this project, I gained experience in areas important for optimizing games, such as multi-threading, caches and GP-GPU. By implementing these techniques and technologies, I was able to create a highly efficient raytracer that can handle tens of thousands of objects with ease, while also supporting advanced features such as reflections.
    <br><br>
    To achieve the high performance for this raytracer, I employed a BVH, as well as a subdivisible screen-space grid to quickly eliminate areas that do not require raytracing.

    This is the first cross-platform I've created, able to run on a Windows PC, but also on any Raspberry Pi; a cheaper way of becoming familiar with console-programming. I gained experience in hardware rendering and OpenGL. More advanced topics, such as instancing, animations and procedural textures were used. I learned my way around ImGui and the Bullet Physics library. The terrain and forests are procedurally generated, with a basic level editor to tweak the parameters as needed. The entire gamestate can be serialized to a compressed file, to be loaded in again at a later time.

    I used autonomous steering combined with a finite state machine to achieve realistic behaviour with coordination among the units, allowing them to move inside enormous formations.

    Acceleration structures were utilized to allow battles between thousands of units.

    This way my first game written in C++.
    The CPU based rendering required significant optimization and introduced me to the workings of rasterization.
    I gained a lot of experience with UI programming during this project.
    Implementing the AI's behaviour familiarised me with AI-programming and pathfinding algorithms.
    The wave function collapse algorithm is utilized by the level editor to determine the visual design of the tilemap.
